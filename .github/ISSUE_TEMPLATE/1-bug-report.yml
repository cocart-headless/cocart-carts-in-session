        Please try testing your site for plugins conflict. 
        To do that deactivate all plugins except for CoCart and WooCommerce. Then test again. 
        If the issue is resolved and all plugins deactivated, it means that one of your plugins is causing the issue. 
        You will then need to enable it one by one and test every time you do that in order to figure out which plugin is causing the issue.
      options:
        - label: I have deactivated other plugins and confirmed this bug occurs when only CoCart plugin is active.
        - label: I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.
